### 1.  Modules of a DBMS (Database Management System) 

Database Management System (DBMS) : A database management system is a software program to develop, administer and access databases. The basic parts of a DBMS are: 

- Database Engine: The backend that store, query and update the data. It guarantees fast data access. 
- Database Schema: It represents the database’s logic structure like tables, relationships, views, constraints etc. 
- Query Processor: Understands and performs database queries (such as SQL queries). It wraps user queries in a set of statements the database engine can comprehend. 
- **Transaction Management**: Manages all database transactions safely. It supports concurrency, rollbacks, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) attributes. 
- **Data Dictionary**: Holds metadata (information about data) such as database structure, constraints and privileges. 
- **User Interface**: Users have access to the DBMS. It can be command line or graphic depending on the system. 

### 2.  What is a Relational Database?  Give 4 Examples  

**Relational Database**- This is the database where the information is kept in tables (relations). These tables contain rows and columns, rows are records and columns are records attributes. - Keys are the way tables are matched (primary, foreign). 

**Examples of Relational Databases:**  
1.  **MySQL**: Open-source relational database. 
2.  **PostgreSQL**: Open source powerful relational database for complex queries and transactions. 
3.  **Oracle Database**: A commercial relational database system for enterprise use. 
4.  **Microsoft SQL Server**: Relational database produced by Microsoft, mostly used in businesses for transactions and data storage. 

### 3.  Three Classifications of SQL  

There are three types of SQL (Structured Query Language): 

1.  **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: A description and control for tables, indexes, schemas, etc. Examples include:  
- `CREATE TABLE`  
- `ALTER TABLE`  
- `DROP TABLE`  

2.  **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Works with dml manipulation on database. There are add, update, and delete commands. Examples include:  
- `INSERT INTO`  
- `UPDATE`  
- `DELETE`  

3.  **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Involved in access control and permissions of the database. Examples include:  
- `GRANT`  
- `REVOKE`  

### 4.  How a Primary Key Is Different From A Foreign Key. 

- **Primary Key**: A primary key is an identification for each record in a table. It prevents duplicates for this key in records. It cannot contain NULL values.  

- e.g: For example, student ID could be primary key in "Students" table. 

- **Foreign Key**: Foreign key is one field (or group of fields) in one table that can be used to identify a row in another table. It makes a connection between the two tables by reference to the other table primary key. 

- E.g. In "Enrollment" table, "Student ID" can be a foreign key of "Student ID" from "Students" table. 

### 5.  What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?  

An **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram** : The diagram depicts the relationships between entities in a database. It is symbols-based to describe objects (or ideas) and relations between them. Important elements of an ER diagram are: 

- **Entities**: Depicted as rectangles, entities are objects/concepts with properties. 
- **Correlations**: Identified with diamonds, they are relationships between objects. 
- **Attributes**: Shaped in ovals, they represent attributes of a thing. 
- **Primary Keys**: Usually marked in the entity. 
- **Foreign Keys**: As a stripe between the foreign key property and some other entity’s primary key. 

### 6.  Advantages of Relational Databases  

Here are a few of the benefits of relational databases: 

- **Data Integrity**: Maintains integrity and reliability of data using constraint like primary key, foreign key, unique key. 
- **Ease of Use**: SQL query language for relational database is standard and widely used so it’s easy to manage the data. 
- **Portability**: Data is easily editable, relationships between data are very clearly drawn. 
- **Scalability**: Relational databases scale up for huge amount of data and complicated queries. 
- **Security**: Security built-in features like permissions, access control, and so on protect data. 

### 7.  Four Data Types for Table Data Management: Here are 4 Data Types that are applied to Table data in Table. 

Four most popular types of data types in relational databases are: 

1.  **INT**: Holds integer (whole number) objects. 
2.  **VARCHAR**: Holds variable length strings or text. 
3.  **DATE**: Defines date value (year, month, day). 
4.  **DECIMAL**: Saves specific numbers - used mainly for the calculation of finance. 

### 8.  The Main Function Of A Database Management System (DBMS) 

**DBMS  Database Management System** is a software used for: 

- **Retrieve and analyze data**: It gives you an organized way to store, extract, and analyze massive quantities of data. 
- **Make the data consistent**: DBMS ensures data consistency via ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). 
- **Ease data access**: It supports easy access to query and manipulate data in languages such as SQL. 
- **Assure security**: A DBMS also has access control and user management to control who can see and edit data. 
- **Backup and recovery**: It is capable of backup and recovery of data.
